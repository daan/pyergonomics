# ZED Development Notebooks

Development notebooks for debugging and comparing ZED SDK body tracking configurations.

## Notebooks

### floor.ipynb
Visual debugging of floor plane detection. Displays the detected floor plane alongside 3D skeleton data to verify correct floor estimation and coordinate system alignment.

### body_tracking.ipynb
Compare multiple body tracking configurations side-by-side. Run the same SVO file with different settings (body format, skeleton smoothing, body fitting) and visualize results in both 2D and 3D views. Each configuration is color-coded for easy comparison.
