# Configuration File (`project.toml`)

The `project.toml` file is the central configuration file for a `pyergonomics` project. It contains metadata about the image sequence and tracking data. This file is automatically generated when you initialize a project using `pyergonomics.configuration.init_project` or `pyergonomics.configuration.init_from_video`.

The file uses the TOML format.

## `[image_sequence]`

This section contains information about the image sequence.

- `number_of_frames` (integer): The total number of frames in the image sequence.
- `frames_per_second` (float): The frame rate of the original video or image sequence.
- `width` (integer): The width of each frame in pixels.
- `height` (integer): The height of each frame in pixels.

## `[tracking]`

This section is optional and contains information about object tracking data.

- `tracking_file` (string): The path to the tracking data file, relative to the `project.toml` file. This is typically a Parquet file.

## Example

Here is an example of a `project.toml` file:

```toml
[image_sequence]
number_of_frames = 1500
frames_per_second = 29.97
width = 1920
height = 1080

[tracking]
tracking_file = "tracking_results.parquet"
```
