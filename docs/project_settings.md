# Configuration File (`project.toml`)

The `project.toml` file is the central configuration file for a `pyergonomics` project. It contains metadata about the project data, which can be video, motion capture, or other time-series data. This file is automatically generated when you initialize a project using the command-line interface.

The file uses the TOML format.

## `[project]`

This section contains generic information about the project.

- `number_of_frames` (integer): The total number of frames in the sequence.
- `frames_per_second` (float): The sampling rate of the data in frames (or samples) per second.
- `pose_skeleton` (string, optional): The name of the pose skeleton used in the project (e.g., "optitrack").

## `[video]`

This section is optional and is present for projects that include video data.

- `source_video` (string): Path to the source video file.
- `width` (integer): The width of each frame in pixels.
- `height` (integer): The height of each frame in pixels.

## `[source_mocap]`

This section is optional and is used for projects that include motion capture data. It holds configuration specific to the mocap source.

## `[tracking]`

This section is optional and contains information about object tracking data.

- `tracking_file` (string): The path to the tracking data file, relative to the `project.toml` file. This is typically a Parquet file.

## Examples

### Video-based Project

Here is an example of a `project.toml` file for a project based on a video:

```toml
[project]
number_of_frames = 1500
frames_per_second = 29.97
pose_skeleton = "optitrack"

[video]
source_video = "path/to/my_video.mp4"
width = 1920
height = 1080

[tracking]
tracking_file = "tracking_results.parquet"
```

### Mocap-based Project

Here is an example for a project with only motion capture data, for example from a BVH file:
```toml
[project]
number_of_frames = 3000
frames_per_second = 120.0
pose_skeleton = "optitrack"

[source_mocap]
bvh_file = "path/to/my_mocap.bvh"

[tracking]
tracking_file = "tracking.parquet"
```
